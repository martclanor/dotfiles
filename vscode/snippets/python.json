	// Place your snippets for python here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Breakpoint": {
		"prefix": ["debugger","pdb"],
		"body": [
			"import pdb; pdb.set_trace()"
		],
		"description": "pdb breakpoint"
	},
    "IfMain": {
        "prefix": ["ifmain"],
        "body": [
            "if __name__ == \"__main__\":",
            "    "
        ]
    },
    "TODO": {
        "prefix": ["td"],
        "body": ["# TODO: "]
    }
}
